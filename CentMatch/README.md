This tool is suitable for comparing any listings where exact match is not suitable. Use this tool for any two listings where we need to check the availability of a term into another listing using approximate matching. e.g. Adverse Events-Concomitant Medications-Medical History-Physical Examination reviews. There are 2 versions, one with matching the occurrences of terms in the same column while another is to match the occurrences or terms in the different listings.

This tool is based on the Levenshtein's Distance method.
